Caveats
-------
1. You need Visual Studio Pro or higher for the Solution to load completely.
2. Update the Connection string called 'CompanyEntities' to correct SQL Database. By default it is setup to connect to (localdb)\v11.0 that comes out of box with VS 2012.
3. You need a database called Company in SQL Server instance pointed to by connection string in 2 above.
4. Run the Company.edmx.sql on the above database to create the table required
5. Sample Data is in dbo.EmployeeInfoes.data.sql file.
